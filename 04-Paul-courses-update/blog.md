Pivotal Academy is pleased to announce our most popular Spring training courses - Core Spring, Spring Web and Enterprise Spring - have been revised to align with the latest Spring 4.2 release. These courses cover many new features and are the perfect opportunity to enhance your skill-set and become _Spring Certified_. Learn about our curriculum below and visit us at https://pivotal.io/academy to schedule your class today.

# Core Spring

Designed for developers and architects, Core Spring is a 4-day class that explores all the basics of using Spring.  The content is broken down into three sections: the Spring Container, Data Management and building Web Applications

* __Container__: configuration using Java Config, Spring annotations like @Autowired, XML bean-files, Aspect Oriented programming and Spring based integration testing.
* __Data Management__: `JdbcTemplate`, caching using `@Cachable`, in-memory embedded databases for testing, Spring managed transactions, JPA and Spring Data
* __Web Applications__: writing Spring MVC Controllers, using Spring Boot, implementing REST using Spring MVC, Spring Security and Cloud Native applications (Spring Cloud)

The course has been overhauled to use Spring 4.2 and covers several features introduced in Spring 4 such as `@Optional` parameters, `@Sql` for database testing and `@RestController`,
Note that as this is a fundamentals course many of the new features in 4.x are beyond its scope.

Another big change to the course is expanding coverage of web applications to include Spring Boot and Building Microservices with Spring Cloud.  And for those of you who may have taken or are familiar with Core Spring 3.x, the course and labs have been fully revamped to use Annotations and Java Configuration.

# Spring Web

Looking for a deep-dive into Spring MVC and related technologies? Our 4-days Spring web course teaches you how to create enterprise web applications across four key areas:

* __Basics__: Spring MVC Controllers, layout management, defining views, using multiple view technologies and form handling
* __Internals__: Configuring a Spring MVC application using web.xml or Servlet 3 Java configuration, understanding Handler Mappers, Handler Adapters, View Resolvers and Interceptors, Internationalization, Resource handling including CORS support, <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc">exception handling</a>
* __Enterprise__: implementing REST, using the `RestTemplate`, Spring Security, Testing with the MockMvc framework, Spring Boot simplification, Web Sockets

This course has also been overhauled to use Spring 4.2 and Java 8 covering Spring 4 features such as `RestControllers`, `AsyncRestTemplate`, `ResponseBodyAdvice`, the resource handling pipeline, Web Sockets and `@CrossOrigin` (CORS). The course also explores Spring Boot since it makes writing Spring MVC applications quick and easy.  However, while this is beneficial, many of the labs do not require Spring Boot as we want attendees to learn how to use MVC fully and be able to override Spring Boot defaults with configurations of their own. 

Pivotal Academy recommends students that are new to Spring attend the Core Spring class prior to attending Spring Web. However, if you have a good working knowledge of Spring and your primary interest is building web-applications, our Spring Web course is the right fit for you.

# Enterprise Spring

Use Spring to build loosely coupled event-driven architectures composed from communicating components and processes. A microservices architecture might be one example of this approach.  Based in part on the popular <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/">Enterprise Integration Patterns</a> book, the course covers inter-process communications using Web Services (REST) and Messaging (JMS, AMQP) and then builds on this foundation to cover Spring Integration and Spring Batch.

Revised for Spring 4.2 the course covers new features such as @JmsListener

Information on this course will be coming soon.
